### Description:

We made a nav bar using \<nav\> tag, its position is fixed and contains the name of the article's section "Space and Cosmos", a SVG for the name of the paper "The New York Times", and two buttons for subscribing and logging in.

We create an article section using \<article\> tag that wraps a header \<h1\> tag, a \<figure\> tag, an \<img\> and a \<figcaption\> and etc. to build up the first part.

Main section contains the author's writings, videos, explanations, a theory hypothesis, we follow a simple order of hierarchy and used \<section\>, \<div\>, \<p\>, \<aside\>, \<iframe\>, and etc. elements positioned with mostly "float"ing.

At the ending, there are recommended articles, writings and editor's pick section. We build up this section by using \<div\> and \<figure\> elements. Also used an \<aside\> element to create the most popular section.

The last part of page is a footer. It includes informative/navigation links. We used \<div\> , \<footer\> , \<ul\> elements and put \<a\> elements to link pages into them.
