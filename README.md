### Description:

We made a nav bar using \<nav\> tag, it's position is fixed and constains the name of the article's section "Space and Cosmos", a SVG for the name of the paper "The New York Times", and two buttons for subscribing and logging in.

We create an article section using \<article\> tag that wraps a header \<h1\> tag, a \<figure\> tag, an \<img\> and a \<figcaption\> and etc to build up the first part.

The rest of the page contains the author's writigns, videos, explanations, a theory hypothesis, we follow a simple order of hierarchy and used \<section\>, \<div\>, \<p\>, \<aside\>, \<iframe\>, and etc. elements positioned with mostly "float"ing.
